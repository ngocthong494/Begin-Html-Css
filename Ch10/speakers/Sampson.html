                <p>What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the 
                    Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the Utah Museum
                    of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the ecology and evolution
                    of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number of countries in Africa. </p>
                <p>Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist 1,vho received his Ph.D. in zoology
                    from the University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of 
                    ceratopsids (horned dinosaurs) from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the
                    gro\Nth and function of certopsid horns and frills. </p>
                <p>Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum
                    of Natural History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor
                    of anatomy at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived
                    at the University of Utah accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the
                    Department of Geology and Geophysics and curator of vertebrate paleontology at
                    the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research interests largely revolve around
                    the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.</p>
                <p>In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
                    work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. 
                    He 1,vas also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a 
                    book, Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossii Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most comprehensive 
                    surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date. </p>
